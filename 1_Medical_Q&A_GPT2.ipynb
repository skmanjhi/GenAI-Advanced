Medical databases or search engines are powerful resources of upto date medical knowledge. However, the existing documentation is large and makes it difficult for professionals to retrieve answers quickly in a clinical setting. The problem with search engines and informative retrieval engines is that these systems return a list of documents rather than answers. Instead, healthcare professionals can use question answering systems to retrieve short sentences or paragraphs in response to medical queries.

Many of these medications can be purchased without a prescription. Nonprescription medications should only be used at the dose and for the length of time recommended on the label unless advised differently by a doctor. Informing the doctor when starting a new medication is important. Antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan, are usually the first drugs recommended to relieve symptoms of indigestion. Many brands on the market use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, calcium, and aluminumwith hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize the acid in the stomach. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt may cause constipation. Aluminum and magnesium salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can also be a supplemental source of calcium, though they may cause constipation. H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) include ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid) and are available both by prescription and over-the-counter. H2RAs treat symptoms of indigestion by reducing stomach acid. They work longer than but not as quickly as antacids. Side effects of H2RAs may include headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and unusual bleeding or bruising. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium) and are available by prescription. Prilosec is also available in over-the-counter strength. PPIs, which are stronger than H2RAs, also treat indigestion symptoms by reducing stomach acid. PPIs are most effective in treating symptoms of indigestion in people who also have GERD. Side effects of PPIs may include back pain, aching, cough, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. Prokinetics such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be helpful for people who have a problem with the stomach emptying too slowly. Metoclopramide also improves muscle action in the digestive tract. Prokinetics have frequent side effects that limit their usefulness, including fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, and involuntary muscle spasms or movements. If testing shows the type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":127}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QvddL7X69NiB"},"source":["### Pre-processing and EDA"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Exercise 2: Perform below operations on the dataset [1 Mark]**\n","\n","- Handle missing values\n","- Remove duplicates from data considering `Question` and `Answer` columns"],"metadata":{"id":"xgB7KCn88Vmj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def understanding_data(df):\n","    print(\"Basic details of the Data-Frame\\n\")\n","    print(\"Dimensions of data frame: \")\n","    print(df.shape)\n","    print('\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n')\n","    print(\"Data-types of the columns and count of non-Null values: \")\n","    print(df.info())\n","    print('\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n')\n","    print(\"Count of Missing values: \")\n","    print(df.isnull().sum())\n","    print('\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n')\n","    print(\"Percentage of Missing values: \")\n","    print(df.isnull().sum() / df.shape[0] * 100.00)\n","    print('\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n')\n","    duplicate = df[df.duplicated()]\n","    print(\"Duplicate Rows :\")\n","    print(duplicate)\n","    print('\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n')\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HDPaJvpHYPeP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["understanding_data(df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"It63GXlPYgTY","outputId":"8d33a667-40ad-4715-cba2-0aa99fc4edf8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Basic details of the Data-Frame\n","\n","Dimensions of data frame: \n","(16412, 6)\n","\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Data-types of the columns and count of non-Null values: \n","<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 16412 entries, 0 to 16411\n","Data columns (total 6 columns):\n"," #

Many of these medications can be purchased without a prescription. Nonprescription medications should only be used at the dose and for the length of time recommended on the label unless advised differently by a doctor. Informing the doctor when starting a new medication is important. Antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan, are usually the first drugs recommended to relieve symptoms of indigestion. Many brands on the market use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, calcium, and aluminumwith hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize the acid in the stomach. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt may cause constipation. Aluminum and magnesium salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can also be a supplemental source of calcium, though they may cause constipation. H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) include ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid) and are available both by prescription and over-the-counter. H2RAs treat symptoms of indigestion by reducing stomach acid. They work longer than but not as quickly as antacids. Side effects of H2RAs may include headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and unusual bleeding or bruising. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium) and are available by prescription. Prilosec is also available in over-the-counter strength. PPIs, which are stronger than H2RAs, also treat indigestion symptoms by reducing stomach acid. PPIs are most effective in treating symptoms of indigestion in people who also have GERD. Side effects of PPIs may include back pain, aching, cough, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. Prokinetics such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be helpful for people who have a problem with the stomach emptying too slowly. Metoclopramide also improves muscle action in the digestive tract. Prokinetics have frequent side effects that limit their usefulness, including fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, and involuntary muscle spasms or movements. If testing shows the type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

No formal diagnostic criteria have not been established for Peters plus syndrome. A clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of features. The following findings may be seen in individuals with Peters plus syndrome : Eye involvement: anomalies of the anterior chamber of the eye (e.g. Peters' anomaly); glaucoma; cataract Short stature Developmental delay Characteristic facial features (e.g. cleft lip and plate) Other associated findings (e.g congenital heart defects; anomalies of the kidney; structural brain malformations; congenital hypothyroidism; conductive hearing loss) The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Peters plus syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n
